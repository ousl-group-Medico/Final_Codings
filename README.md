Project Scope:
From the Patients’ perspective:
  Patients do not need to keep remembering their history of diseases.
  Patients do not need to carry clinic books or prescriptions.
  
  
 From Doctors' perspective:
  They can clearly understand the patient’s history.
  Doctors can treat critically ill patients quickly.


From Pharmacists’ perspective:
  They will be able to understand the prescription clearly
  So, the risk of giving the wrong medicine can be avoided
